# Networking-with-Packet-Tracer
Training network management with Cisco's software, Packet Tracer.

## Goal
Build a complex home network with strict security measures, subnets and totally functional access to the internet or other networks.

## Procedures
Firstly I built 2 small networks linked by a router, with small security measures like password protection and encryption for the router and switch. I also allocated a DHCP server with a single pool os ips for one of the networks.

## To be Done
* DNS server
* HTTP server
* VLAN for specific accesses
* Internet (ISP, Cloud, etc.)
* Acesss Point
  
And finally something else that I think would be a nice addition.
